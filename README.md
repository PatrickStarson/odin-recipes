# odin-recipes

This will be a simple recipe page with mostly HTML at this point.

This is the point in my Odin Project progress where I'll be practicing HTML.
I have so far allready learn some HTML on my own and through tutorials and other resources, but with TOP I feel that things I learned are getting more structured in my view on what I'll be doing working as a frontend developer.
